Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3
* Fixed in version 2.4.4

Impact:

Remote execution of untrusted code, DoS

Description:

When an application has Groovy on the classpath and uses standard Java serialization mechanisms to communicate between servers, or to store local data, it is possible for an attacker to bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.

Mitigation:

Apache Groovy 2.4.4 is the first supported release under the Apache Software Foundation. It is strongly recommended that all users using serialization upgrade to this version.
If you cannot upgrade or rely on an older, unsupported version of Groovy, you can apply the following patch on the `MethodClosure` class (`src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java`):

```
 public class MethodClosure extends Closure {
+    private Object readResolve() {
+        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
+    }
```

Alternatively, you should make sure to use a custom security policy file (using the standard Java security manager) or make sure that you do not rely on serialization to communicate remotely.

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3
* Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7
* Fixed in version 2.4.8

Impact:

Remote execution of untrusted code, DoS

Description:

When an application with Groovy on classpath uses standard
Java serialization mechanisms, e.g. to communicate between servers
or to store local data, it is possible for an attacker to bake a special
serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized.
All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the
code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.
This is similar to CVE-2015-3253 but this exploit involves extra
wrapping of objects and catching of exceptions which are now safe
guarded against.

Mitigation:

Users of Groovy relying on (de)serialization with the affected versions
should apply one of the following mitigations:

* Isolate the code doing the (de)serialization
* Upgrade to Apache Groovy 2.4.8 or later
* Users of older versions of Groovy can apply the following patch to the
`MethodClosure` class (`src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java`):

```
public class MethodClosure extends Closure {
+    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream) throws
IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
+        if (ALLOW_RESOLVE) {
+            stream.defaultReadObject();
+        }
+        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
+    }
```

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 2.0 to 2.4.4.
Apache Groovy versions 2.4.4 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13,
3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1.

Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2

Impact:

This vulnerability potentially impacts Unix-like systems, and very old
versions of Mac OSX and Windows. On such OS versions, Groovy may create
temporary directories within the OS temporary directory which is shared
between all users on affected systems. Groovy will create such directories
for internal use when producing Java Stubs (very low impact) or on behalf
of user code via two extension methods[4,5] for creating temporary directories.
If Groovy user code uses either of these extension methods, and stores
executable code in the resulting temporary directory, then the risk is high,
since this can lead to local privilege escalation. If such Groovy code is making
use of the temporary directory to store sensitive information, then the risk is
medium, since such information could be exposed or modified.

When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important
questions to ask:

Is the Groovy code running on a machine with an impacted operating system?
Do other users have access to the machine running the Groovy code?
Does the Groovy code create temporary directories using Groovy's
createTempDir extension methods[4,5]?

If you answer no to any of these questions, you are not affected.
If you answered yes, does the Groovy code write or store executable code
in the temporary directory? If you answer yes, the risk is high, and can lead to
local privilege escalation. Does the Groovy code write sensitive information,
like API keys or passwords, into the temporary directory? If you answer yes,
the risk is medium, and information may be exposed or modified.

Description:

Groovy was making use of a method in the JDK which is now flagged as not
suitable for security-sensitive contexts. In addition, Groovy wasn't checking
a flag related to successful creation of the temporary directory which leads
to a race condition whereby the vulnerability exists[1].

For the fixed versions, Groovy 2.5 and above is now using a newer JDK method
which creates a directory that is only readable by the user running the Groovy
code. The same is true for the fixed Groovy 2.4 version except if running
on a pre-JDK7 version of the JDK in which case a fallback implementation is
used which now checks for successful creation of the temporary directory.
This eliminates the high-risk scenario involving the race condition whereby
executables or information could be modified, but still leaves the potential
for sensitive information leakage. Groovy 2.4/JDK 6 users are recommended
to use the `java.io.tmpdir` mitigation.

Mitigation:

Setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory
that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability
for all operating systems and all Groovy versions.

Users who cannot easily move to the fixed Groovy versions may wish to
consider using the JDK's Files#createTempDirectory method instead of the
Groovy extension methods.
