== Abstract: JSON Support

Provide a builder/slurper combination for handling data in JSON format in a similar fashion as it's already done for XML.

== Rationale

JSON has become ubiquitous to the web. RESTful services exchange data in both POX (Plain Old XML) and JSON formats.
Groovy has excellent support for producing/consuming XML with MarkupBuilder, XmlSlurper and XmlParser but lacks this
kind support for JSON. This GEP strives to remedy the situation, by providing a compatible builder approach.

=== Producing JSON
The following builder syntax is proposed

```
def builder = new groovy.json.JsonBuilder()
def root = builder.people {
    person {
        firstName 'Guillame'
        lastName 'Laforge'
        // Maps are valid values for objects too
        address(
            city: 'Paris',
            country: 'France',
            zip: 12345,
        )
        married true
        conferences 'JavaOne', 'Gr8conf'
    }
}

// creates a data structure made of maps (Json object) and lists (Json array)
assert root instanceof Map

println builder.toString()

// prints (without formatting)
{"people": {
    "person": {
        "firstName": "Guillaume",
        "lastName": "Laforge",
        "address": {
           "city": "Paris",
           "country": "France",
           "zip": 12345
        },
        "married": true,
        "conferences": [
            "JavaOne",
            "Gr8conf"
        ]
    }
}
```

Valid node values are: `Number`, `String`, `GString`, `Boolean`, `Map`, `List`. `null` is reserved for object references.
Arrays can not be null, but they can be empty. Anything else results in an IAE (or a more specialized exception) being thrown.

=== Special cases

There is a special case to be considered: when the top node results in an anonymous object or array.
or objects a call() method on the builder is needed which takes a map as argument, for arrays call() takes a vararg of values. Here are some examples:

```
builder.foo "foo"
// produces
{foo: "foo"}
```

```
builder([{
  foo 'foo'
}])
// produces
[{"foo": "foo"}]
```

```
builder([[
  foo: 'foo'
]])
// produces, same as above
[{"foo": "foo"}]
```

```
builder {
    elem 1, 2, 3
}
// produces
{ "elem": [1, 2, 3] }
```
When a method is called on the builder without arguments, and empty JSON object is associated with the key:

```
builder.element()
// produces
{ "element": {} }
```

You can also pass a map and a closure argument:
```
builder.person(name: "Guillaume", age: 33) { town "Paris" }

// produces
{"name": "Guillaume", "age": 33, "town": "Paris}
```

Calls like the following, with a map and a value, don't have any meaningful representation in JSON (unlike in XML), and triggers a JsonException:

```
shouldFail(JsonException) {
    builder.elem(a: 1, b: 2, "some text value")
}
```

In case of overlapping keys in the map and the closure, the closure wins â€“ a visual clue for this rule is that the closure appears "after" the map key/value pairs.

Consuming JSON
The proposal is for the creation of a JsonSlurper class that can read JSON from a string (in a non-streaming fashion) and produce a hierarchy of maps and lists representing the JSON objects and arrays respectively.
```
String json = '{"person": {"firstName": "Guillaume", "lastName": "Laforge", "conferences": ["JavaOne", "Gr8conf"]}}'
def root = new JsonSlurper().parseText(json)
assert root instanceof Map
assert root.person.conferences instanceof List
assert root.person.firstName == 'Guillaume'
assert root.person.conferences[1] == 'Gr8conf'
```
JsonSlurper's API should mirror closely what XmlParser/XmlSlurper offers in terms of its parse* method variants.
