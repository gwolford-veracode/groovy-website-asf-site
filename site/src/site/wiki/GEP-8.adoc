== Abstract: Static Type Checking

This GEP introduces a new feature in the language known as static type checking.
It is often disturbing for developers coming from a statically typed language (say Java)
to discover that the Groovy compiler will not complain at compile time:

* when assignments are made on different types
* when a method doesn't exist
* when a property or variable doesn't exist
* when returned object type doesn't match the method signature
* ...

All those are silent because the dynamic nature of the Groovy language makes such code perfectly valid.
However, in some situations, a developer may want Groovy to behave like a statically typed language
and have the compiler give hints about such "errors". To do this, Groovy must introduce static type checking.

== Rationale: Static Type Checking vs Static compilation

It is important to make the difference between static type checking and static compilation.
The goal of this GEP is to have an option to turn static type checking (STC) on.
If STC is activated, the compiler will be more verbose (you will also see the term "grumpy"),
but in the end, the generated bytecode and runtime behaviour will be exactly the same as if you
did not activate this mode. This is a major difference from an alternate compiler like Groovy++
which will perform STC then produce a different bytecode and therefore produce different runtime semantics.
The scope of this GEP is only a static type checker, and therefore should only be considered as a
feature which allows developers to write statically checked code, so is an elegant way for example
to leverage the Groovy syntax to reduce verbosity of Java code while still getting strongly checked code.
Eventually, IDE could support the STC mode and provide information to the developer.

=== Implementation details

==== Development branch

Since Groovy 2.0-beta-2, code has been merged into master branch. However, if heavy developments are
done on the type checker, it is advisable to work on the grumpy branch. It adds an AST transformation
named TypeChecked. If set, then the AST transformation will perform type inference and store type
information in AST nodes metadata. Eventually, if errors are found, it will add errors to the compiler
through a dedicated addStaticTypeError method which basically does the same as the traditional
addError method but prefixes the messages with a "Static type checking" message.
This is done to help the developer determine whether the error they are seeing is a "plain Groovy" error,
or an error thrown by the STC mode.

==== The StaticTypeCheckingTestCase class

Static type checking behaviour must be tested. As there are tons of possible checks to be done,
a base test class provides a framework for testing this mode.
Unit tests for static type checking should override this class.

=== Decisions made

==== About this section

The goal of this section is to provide code samples which demonstrates in what case the STC transformation
will actually complain and what is the expected error message, and serves as a basis to future STC documentation.
This section may not be up-to-date, and one should always take a look at the STC unit tests found in the
`src/test/groovy/transform/stc` directory.

=== Open discussions

==== Closure parameter type inference

With the current version of the checker, idiomatic constructs like :

```
['a','b','c'].collect { it.toUpperCase() }
```

Are not properly recognized. You have to explicitly set the type of the "it" parameter inside the closure.
It is because the expected parameter types of closures are unknown at compile time.
There is a discussion about how to add this type information to source code so that the inference
engine can deal with them properly. The implementation of closure parameter type inference requires
a change to the method signatures. It will probably not belong to the initial release of the type checker.

==== Unification Types

In cases of for example `x instanceof A || x instanceof B` with A and B being unrelated we could
still make an artificial union kind of type, that contains everything present in A and B,
to allow those kinds of method calls. The alternative to this is to allow only methods from Object here,
which is less interesting. This typing can also be used for multicatch, ensuring that a method call is
only valid if it exists on each of the exceptions for the multicatch.
In the current implementation (2011-10-14) the multicatch is already expanded at the point @TypeChecked will check.
Meaning effectively this already represents a kind of union type, as the same code is in each catch block
and thus the method call would fail, if the method is not available on each type.
The proposed behaviour is therefore to align the instanceof case with multicatch.
