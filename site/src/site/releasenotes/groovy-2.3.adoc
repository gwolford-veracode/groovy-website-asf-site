[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-OfficialsupportforrunningGroovyonJDK8]]
== Official support for running Groovy on JDK 8

This is the first version of Groovy to be officially compatible with JDK
8.

JDK 8 and its interface default methods introduced some
incompatibilities with a few methods of the Groovy Development Kit, so
we had to adapt to the situation, introducing minor breaking changes for
the affected methods and their outcome.

Note that we’re not planning to backport the changes to older versions
of Groovy, so if you want to run Groovy on JDK 8, you’ll have to upgrade
to the shiniest version of Groovy!

Groovy 2.3 doesn’t support the new syntax constructs offered by Java 8
(such as lambdas, method references, default methods in interfaces,
etc.), but you can very well already *use the new APIs offered by JDK
8*, and even *use Groovy closures in lieu of Java 8 lambdas*.

For reference, here are a couple of examples which use Java 8 streams,
for iterating over a stream of ints, or over the lines of a file:

[source,groovy]
----
IntStream.range(1, 100).forEach { println it }

Files.lines(Paths.get('README.adoc'))
     .map { it.toUpperCase() }
     .forEach { println it }
----


In particular, in the two statements above, notice that we replaced Java
8 lambdas with Groovy closures, as Groovy provides a closure coercion
mechanism which transforms a Groovy closure into a functional interface
— unlike Java, Groovy also provides that coercion mechanism for abstract
classes containing a single abstract method.

In future versions of Groovy, certain Java 8 syntax constructs, or
particular Groovy methods decorating JDK 8 APIs might be added.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Traits]]
== Traits

A major highlight for Groovy 2.3 is the introduction of the *concept of traits*.

link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/documentation/core-traits.html[Traits]
are reusable components of behavior that your classes can implement, and
are an additional Object-Oriented concept alongside classes and
interfaces.

Below, we create a trait with a concrete method `fly()` which returns a
`String`.

[source,groovy]
----
trait FlyingAbility {
    String fly() { "I'm flying!" }
}
----

Then we create a class, `Bird`, that implements that trait, and
instantiate it:

[source,groovy]
----
class Bird implements FlyingAbility {}
def b = new Bird()
----

We can check that the Bird instance does have the new `fly()` method
mixed-in:

[source,groovy]
----
assert b.fly() == "I'm flying!"
----

Groovy traits are stateful (unlike Java 8 interface default methods).
A trait can have Groovy properties like plain classes:

[source,groovy]
----
trait Named {
    String name
}
----

This time, the `Bird` class implements that `Named` trait:

[source,groovy]
----
class Bird implements Named {}
----

We can instantiate the Bird with the named-argument constructor shortcut
provided by Groovy:

[source,groovy]
----
def b = new Bird(name: 'Colibri')
----

We assert that the instantiated Bird does have the name property added
to it:

[source,groovy]
----
assert b.name == 'Colibri'
----

They allow the composition of behavior without going into the "diamond
inheritance" problem allowing you to decide which behavior prevails
upon conflict, either by convention (last trait declared wins) or by
explicitly overriding the conflicting method:

[source,groovy]
----
trait KiteSurfer { String surf() { 'kite' } }

trait WebSurfer  { String surf() {  'web' } }

class Person { String name }

class Hipster extends Person
           implements KiteSurfer, WebSurfer {}

def h = new Hipster()
assert h.surf() == 'web'
----

Above, the `surf()` method from `WebSurfer` wins, as it’s the last declared
trait, but you can reverse the trait implementation order if you want
kite to be returned. If you want to be more explicit, your `Hipster` class
can override the `surf()` method itself, and call `WebSurfer.super.foo()` or
`KiteSurfer.super.foo()` or do something entirely different.

Traits support inheritance, thus a trait can extend another trait or
implement an interface, as shown below:

[source,groovy]
----
trait Named { String name }

trait FlyingAbility extends Named {
    String fly() { "I'm a flying ${name}!" }
}

class Bird implements FlyingAbility {}
def b = new Bird(name: 'Colibri')

assert b.name == 'Colibri'
assert b.fly() == "I'm a flying Colibri!"
----

Traits are compatible with static type checking and compilation, as well
as our usual dynamic behavior. Trait mixed-in methods are actually
"real" methods (i.e. visible from Java as well) and not just dynamic.
Note however, that not all existing AST transformations are compatible
with traits.

Traits can also be implemented at runtime with `as` or with
`withTraits` if you just want to add behavior of a trait to an object
you’re instantiating, without having to create an intermediary
artificial class just for that purpose (also called per-instance
traits):

[source,groovy]
----
trait Named { String name }

trait Quacks {
    String quack() { 'Quack!' }
}

class Animal {}

def na = new Animal().withTraits Named, Quacks
na.name = 'Daffy'
assert na.name == 'Daffy'
assert na.quack() == 'Quack!'
----

You can find more information on traits in the
exhaustive link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/documentation/core-traits.html[traits documentation].

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-NewandupdatedASTtransformations]]
== New and updated AST transformations

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Newtransformations]]
=== New transformations

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-TailRecursive]]
==== @TailRecursive

`@TailRecursive` on methods adds tail recursion to methods which are
recursive and call themselves at the last operation of the method body,
which helps avoid blowing up the stack with the recursive calls
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6570[GROOVY-6570]).

Here’s a slightly rewritten factorial implementation, that is friendly
to tail-call transformation:

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.transform.TailRecursive

@TailRecursive
def fact(BigInteger n, accu = 1G) {
    if (n < 2) accu
    else fact(n - 1, n * accu)
}

assert fact(1000) > 10e2566
----

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Builder]]
==== @Builder

Recent Java APIs have adopted the builder pattern (not to be confused
with Groovy’s builders) to instantiate complex objects, without
requiring to multiply the number of constructors with variants taking
various combination of parameters. Groovy 2.3 introduces a `@Builder`
transformation to automate the creation of such builder APIs
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6484[GROOVY-6484]).

The `@Builder` transformation offers different implementation strategies
that you can choose from:

* a simple strategy for creating chained setters
* an external strategy where you annotate an explicit builder class
while leaving some _buildee class_ being built untouched
* a default strategy which creates a nested helper class for instance
creation
* and an initializer strategy which creates a nested helper class for
instance creation which when used with `@CompileStatic` allows type-safe
object creation

Here’s an example with the default strategy:

[source,groovy]
-----
import groovy.transform.builder.Builder

@Builder
class Person {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    int age
}

def person = Person.builder()
                   .firstName("Robert")
                   .lastName("Lewandowski")
                   .age(21)
                   .build()

assert person.firstName == "Robert"
assert person.lastName == "Lewandowski"
assert person.age == 21
-----

You can have a look at
the link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/documentation/core-metaprogramming.html#xform-Builder[@Builder documentation]
for the other builder variants.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Sortable]]
==== @Sortable

`@Sortable` on classes implements comparison methods for you (through
implementing the `Comparable` interface), according to the declaration
order of your properties
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6649[GROOVY-6649]).

For the following `Person` class, its instances will be sorted by last
name, then by first name, and by age, in that order:

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.transform.*

@Sortable
@Canonical
class Person {
    String last
    String first
    int age
}

def folks = [
    new Person('Simpson', 'Bart', 12),
    new Person('Simpson', 'Homer', 40),
    new Person('Kent', 'Clark', 36)
]

assert folks.sort()*.first == ['Clark', 'Bart', 'Homer']
----

Additionally, you can define included / excluded fields, access
individual field comparators with methods like `comparatorByFirst()`.

More details on
the {DOCS_BASEURL}/html/documentation/core-metaprogramming.html#xform-Sortable[@Sortable documentation] page.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-SourceURI]]
==== @SourceURI

With `@SourceURI`, you can annotate a `java.net.URI` or even a
`java.lang.String` script variable or class field so that the variable or
field are injected the URI of the Groovy file.

If you evaluate or compile a Groovy script or class, the variable or
field will contain a data URI, for example, for the following example:

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.transform.SourceURI

@SourceURI String src

println src
----

The `src` variable will contain the following data URI:

----
data:,import%20groovy.transform.SourceURI%0A%0A@SourceURI%20String%20src%0A%0Aprintln%20src
----

If you save the script in a file called `sourceuri.groovy` in `/tmp`, and
run that script with the `groovy` command, you’ll see an absolute `File`
path printed:

----
file:/tmp/sourceuri.groovy
----

As we mentioned above, you can also write `@SourceURI URI src`, if you want
to have a `URI` instead of a `String`.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Updatedtransformations]]
=== Updated transformations

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Delegateimprovements]]
==== @Delegate improvements

`@Delegate` supports `includeTypes` and `excludeTypes` attributes to give you
fine-grained control over which methods to include or exclude from
delegation. Rather than just matching on name, this option matches on
the name and parameter types expressed in an interface type
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6329[GROOVY-6329]).

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-BaseScriptclassimprovements]]
==== @BaseScript class improvements

{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/gapi/groovy/transform/BaseScript.html[@BaseScript]
is a fairly recent addition in Groovy, and it allowed to annotate a
variable in your script to instruct the compiler to use a particular
base script class for this script. Now we have another notation which is
nicer as you can annotate an import or a package
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6592[GROOVY-6592]) to indicate
that base script class:

[source,groovy]
----
@BaseScript(MyScript)
import groovy.transform.BaseScript
----

Additionally, base script classes can now use any abstract method for
the script body. This means that you can implement the `run()` method to
implement specific behavior like setup and tear down in tests
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6585[GROOVY-6585]
and link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6615[GROOVY-6615]).

Given the following custom base script class, where we implement the
default `run()` method, we also create a new abstract method called
`internalRun()`:

[source,groovy]
----
abstract class CustomBase extends Script {
    def run() {
        before()
        internalRun()
        after()
    }

    abstract internalRun()

    def before() { println 'before' }
    def after()  { println 'after'  }
}
----

We can then have the script below transparently implement the
`internalRun()` method instead of the usual `run()` one:

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.transform.BaseScript
@BaseScript CustomBase script

println 'Hello'
----

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-NewNIOmoduleforJava7]]
== New NIO module for Java 7+

On JDK 7 and beyond, you can benefit from the same methods as the ones
of File but for the new NIO2 class `Path`.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6377[GROOVY-6377] and
the link:https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/pull/260/files[pull request]
for some further hints of the new methods.

You’ll find familiar methods of the Groovy GDK on `File` also available on
`Path` like these:

[source,groovy]
----
path.withReader { Reader r -> ... }
path.eachLine { String line -> ... }
path.eachFileRecurse { Path p -> ... }
path << 'some content'
path << bytes
path.readLines()
----

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Performanceimprovements]]
== Performance improvements

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Miscellanousimprovements]]
=== Miscellaneous improvements

Various minor *performance improvements across the board*, for static
compilation, the `invokedynamic` backend, as well as "normal"
dynamic Groovy, have been worked on.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-DrasticJSONparsingandserializationperformanceimprovements]]
=== Drastic JSON parsing and serialization performance improvements

Groovy JSON support has been refactored and tailored towards
performance, making Groovy 2.3’s JSON support usually
*faster than all the JSON libraries* available in the Java ecosystem.

Rick Hightower and Andrey Bleschestov covered the performance gains,
both in parsing and serialization, in
a link:http://rick-hightower.blogspot.fr/2014/04/groovy-and-boon-provide-fastest-json.html[benchmarks on Rick’s blog]
and on link:https://github.com/bura/json-benchmarks[Andrey’s JSON benchmark project on GitHub].
The results are impressive, as the *parsing is generally roughly 2x to 4x faster* with Groovy’s new
parsers compared to existing libraries, and *~21x faster than pre-Groovy 2.3 parsing*.
On the serialization front, Groovy’s
new *serialization is also ~17x faster than before*, and at the same
level as competing libraries.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-JSONslurperandbuilderenhancements]]
== JSON slurper and builder enhancements

Beside the performance improvements of the JSON module, other updates
have taken place.

With link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/gapi/groovy/json/JsonSlurper.html[JsonSlurper],
you’ll be able to set
different link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/gapi/groovy/json/JsonParserType.html[parser types]
depending on the kind of input you wish to parse, particularly if
you know the size of the payload you expect to parse, or whether you
want a more tolerant parser which accepts elements like comments which
are not normally supported by the JSON specification.

Here’s an example showing how to parse a non-conformant JSON payload:

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.json.*
import static groovy.json.JsonParserType.*

def parser = new JsonSlurper().setType(LAX)

def conf = parser.parseText '''
    // configuration file
    {
        // no quote for key, single quoted value
        environment: 'production'
        # pound-style comment
        'server': 5
    }
'''

assert conf.environment == 'production'
assert conf.server == 5
----

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Closureparametertypeinference]]
== Closure parameter type inference

We closed a gap which forced you to type your closure parameters to get
correct type inference with static type checking or static compilation
enabled. In situations like the following, you would have to explicitly
give the type of the parameter, but it’s no longer required:

[source,groovy]
----
['a','b'].each { it.toUpperCase() }
----

In the signature of your methods taking closures as arguments, you’ll
also be able to annotate the closure parameter
with link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/gapi/groovy/transform/stc/ClosureParams.html[@ClosureParams]
to give additional hints to the type checker to infer the type of the
parameters passed to your closure.

You can also find more about this in Cédric’s blog post
on link:http://melix.github.io/blog/2014/01/closure_param_inference.html[closure parameter type inference].

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Newmarkuptemplateengine]]
== New markup template engine

Groovy now has an additional template engine, in the form of the Markup
template engine, which gives you a very fast template engine (thanks to
static compilation), based on the familiar Markup builder approach and
notation, but also offering formatting options (indentation, escaping),
internationalization, includes, as well as proposing type checked
templates and models.

More details about the
new link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/documentation/templating.html#_the_markuptemplateengine[Markup template engine]
in the documentation, as well as in Cédric’s link:http://melix.github.io/blog/[blog], if you want to learn more
about the "behind the scenes" stories!

To illustrate the basic usage, consider you have the following template:

[source,groovy]
----
def tpl = '''
    cars {
        cars.each {
            car(make: it.make, name: it.name)
        }
    }
'''
----

And have the following model:

[source,groovy]
----
model = [cars: [
    new Car(make: 'Peugeot', name: '508'),
    new Car(make: 'Toyota',  name: 'Prius')
]]
----

You would generate the following XML (or HTML) output:

[source,xml]
----
<cars>
    <car make='Peugeot' name='508'/>
    <car make='Toyota'  name='Prius'/>
</cars>
----

By doing the following:

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.text.markup.*

def config = new TemplateConfiguration()
def engine = new MarkupTemplateEngine(config)
def tmpl = engine.createTemplate(tpl)
System.out << tmpl.make(model)
----

You have useful methods available to your templates, like for including
other templates:

[source,groovy]
----
// include another template
include template: 'foo.tpl'

// include raw content
include unescaped: 'raw.txt'

// escape & include
include escaped: 'to_escape.txt'
----

And if you want to have your model be type checked, you can either
define the model types inside the template like so:

[source,groovy]
----
modelTypes = {
    List<Car> cars
}
----

Or by using the dedicated template creation method:

[source,groovy]
----
def modelTypes = [cars: "List<Car>"]

def tmpl = engine.createTypeCheckedModelTemplate(tpl, modelTypes)
----

Note that this template engine is super fast as it’s statically
compiled.

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-JUnit4GroovyAssertclass]]
== JUnit 4 GroovyAssert class

The
venerable link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/gapi/groovy/test/GroovyTestCase.html[GroovyTestCase]
(JUnit 3 based approach) has often been used as a base class for your
test classes — unless you’ve been using
the link:http://www.spockframework.org/[Spock testing framework], of course.
One of the drawback of this class is that your test classes can’t extend
your own classes, but must derive from `GroovyTestCase` to benefit from
the additional assertion methods.

In earlier versions of Groovy we introduced the JUnit
4-friendly link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/gapi/groovy/test/GroovyAssert.html[GroovyAssert],
which is a convenient class offering the usual assertion methods of
`GroovyTestCase`, but in the form of static methods that you can static
import in your test class. In Groovy 2.3, we’ve enriched `GroovyAssert`
with additional features. With these additions, there should be no functionality which is restricted to just JUnit 3,
so feel free to move to later versions if you haven’t already done so. We didn’t include all the
myriad of `assertEquals` methods from `GroovyTestCase` as they are typically
less useful than Groovy’s built-in power assert, but it provides some
handy `shouldFail()` and `assertScript()` methods
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6588[GROOVY-6588]).

For instance, if you want to leverage the `shouldFail(String)` and
`assertScript(String)` methods, you can do so as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
import static groovy.test.GroovyAssert.shouldFail


import org.junit.Test

class AssertTest {
    @Test void checkBadAddition() {
        shouldFail '''
            groovy.test.GroovyAssert.assertScript 'assert 1 + 1 == 3'
        '''
    }
}
----

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-ConfigSlurper]]
== ConfigSlurper

ConfigSlurper has previously supported a single "environments"
non-configurational conditional block, but you couldn’t define your own.
With Groovy 2.3 you can also create your own such blocks. For instance
if you wanted to support "flavors" like OS variants
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6383[GROOVY-6383]).

Concretely, instead of the familiar environments / production blocks in
Grails, let’s register a flavors / prod pair: 

[source,groovy]
----
def conf = '''
    a.b.c = 1
    flavors {
        prod {
            a.b.c = 2
        }
    }
'''

def slurper = new ConfigSlurper('prod')
slurper.registerConditionalBlock('flavors', 'prod')

def config = slurper.parse(conf)

assert config.a.b.c == 2
----

In addition, the `isSet()` / `hasSet()` combo methods
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-4639[GROOVY-4639]) have been
added so you can double-check if a given node of your configuration has
been defined. Before, whether the node wasn’t defined or containing
`null`, you couldn’t differentiate either case easily.

* *Ant 1.9.3* for the Ant builder
* *TestNG 6.8.8* for the TestNG module

[[Groovy2.3releasenotes-Breakingchanges]]
== Breaking changes

Groovy 2.3.0 introduces a limited list of breaking changes.

First of all,*Groovy 2.3.0 now requires JDK 6* as its minimal JDK
requirement. Some parts of Groovy 2.3.0 might still run under JDK 5 but
no testing has been done on that platform and some parts are known not
to work. We encourage everyone to move to at least JDK 6.

In Groovy 2.3.0, we *reworked our implementation of generics handling*.
Although we don’t know of any particular breakage so far, the static
type checker might report new errors as it can be stricter than before.
If ever you encounter such new errors in this area, please report them
as soon as you encounter them.

With the introduction of "traits" in Groovy 2.3, the `trait` keyword
is an addition to the list of keyword of the languages, with the
consequence that *variables or fields that would use `trait` as name
with yield a compilation error*. So you would have to change the name of
your variable and recompile your code.

A few updates have been made to the *XML support around whitespace
handling, and text node handling*:

* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6685[GROOVY-6685]
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6683[GROOVY-6683]
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6682[GROOVY-6682]
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6678[GROOVY-6678]
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6621[GROOVY-6621]

With the new default methods on interfaces in JDK 8, there was
particularly one,
a link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6465[List#sort(Comparable) method], which *conflicted with one of the GDK*,
so we had to remove ours to stay compliant with JDK 8.

We fixed a link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6456[race condition in AbstractHttpServlet#applyResourceNameMatcher]
