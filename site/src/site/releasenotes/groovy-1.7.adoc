[[Groovy17releasenotes-IDESupport]]
== IDE Support

Before diving directly into the new features in Groovy 1.7, please let
me mention the great progress made in terms of IDE support for Groovy
(and also for http://griffon-framework.org/[Griffon],
http://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://github.com/Gant/Gant[Gant] or
http://grails.org/[Grails]). All the major IDEs provide excellent support for Groovy including https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse[Eclipse],
IntelliJ IDEA (supports https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/groovy.html[Groovy] & https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/grails.html[Grails]), and https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorial/main/kb/docs/java/groovy-quickstart/[NetBeans].
Initially, the Eclipse support was
the one lacking the most, but thanks to the hard work of the
SpringSource Eclipse team, we now have a great environment for
developing mixed Java / Groovy applications with features like
cross-language refactoring, Groovy-specific code completion, and more.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-AnonymousInnerClassesandNestedClasses]]
=== Anonymous Inner Classes and Nested Classes

Although oftentimes closures and maps coercion suffice, there are still
areas where the lack of Anonymous Inner Classes (AIC) and Nested Classes
(NC) can be problematic. That’s why we decided to eventually implement
AIC and NC in Groovy 1.7.

.Be Careful
****
The implementation of AIC and NC follows the Java lead, but
you should not take out the Java Language Spec and keep shaking the head
about things that are different. The implementation done looks much like
what we do for groovy.lang.Closure, with some benefits and some
differences. Accessing private fields and methods for example can become
a problem, but on the other hand local variables don’t have to be final.
****

[[Groovy17releasenotes-NestedStaticClasses]]
==== Nested Static Classes

Here’s an example of Nested Static Classes:

[source,groovy]
---------------------
class A {
    static class B {}
}

new A.B()
---------------------

The usage of static nested classes is the best supported one. If you
absolutely need an inner class, you should make it a static one.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-AnonymousInnerClasses]]
==== Anonymous Inner Classes

Some other examples, this time for Anonymous Inner Classes:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------
boolean called = false

Timer timer = new Timer()
timer.schedule(new TimerTask() {
    void run() {
        called = true
    }
}, 0)
sleep 100

assert called
--------------------------------

.More information
****
If you want to learn a bit more about the cases which
are currently supported in 1.7, you can have a look at one of our unit
tests covering this new feature.
****

[[Groovy17releasenotes-AccessingtheOuterContextfromaNestedClass]]
==== Accessing the Outer Context from a Nested Class

If you are in a nested class Y and the surrounding class is X, then you
can access the variable v of X in Java by X.this.v. Groovy does not
support this syntax.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-CreatingInstancesofNon-StaticInnerClasses]]
==== Creating Instances of Non-Static Inner Classes

In Java, you can do this:

[source,java]
----------------------------------
public class Y {
    public class X {}
    public X foo() {
        return new X();
    }
    public static X createX(Y y) {
        return y.new X();
    }
}
----------------------------------

It should be noted that the nested class X needs a reference to the
outer class instance of Y. For this, Java will create a constructor that
takes Y as first parameter in X. This constructor is synthetic, so it
won't appear in any code completion.

In case of `new X()`, like in method `foo`, the compiler
will create a `new X(this)` instead. In case of `createX` the compiler
will create `new X(y)`. Groovy does not currently support this.

Instead, Groovy supports explicitly giving the instance in like the compiler would
do it. That means the code above has to be rewritten as

[source,groovy]
----------------------------------
public class Y {
    public class X {}
    public X foo() {
        return new X(this);
    }
    public static X createX(Y y) {
        return new X(y);
    }
}
----------------------------------

.Caution
****
Caution though, Groovy supports calling methods with one
parameter without giving an argument. The parameter will then have the
value null. Basically the same rules apply to calling a constructor.
There is a danger that you will write new X() instead of new X(this) for
example. Since this might also be the regular way we have not yet found
a good way to prevent this problem.
****

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Annotations]]
=== Annotations

Groovy’s support of annotations is identical to Java 5 annotations, but
we felt that in some cases it would be interesting to be able to add
annotations in other places than the usual places (types, fields,
methods, parameters, etc.). For instance, in Java, it is impossible to
add annotations on imports or packages. Groovy does go beyond and adds
support for annotation on imports, packages and variable declarations.
We’ll take a look at the usage of those extended annotations on Grape.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Grape]]
==== Grape

The Grape dependency system lets you request dependencies in your
scripts, without having to deal with downloading, packaging, or
specifying the classpath yourself. To use Grape, we had to use the @Grab
annotation to `grab` a dependency from a repository (Maven's central
repository, for example). The problem was that annotation had to be
attached to some allowed elements, i.e. the places where annotations can
be put in Java. Now, we can put annotations on imports:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Grab(group='net.sf.json-lib', module='json-lib', version='2.3', classifier='jdk15')
import net.sf.json.groovy.*

assert new JsonSlurper().parseText(
    new JsonGroovyBuilder().json {
        book(title: "Groovy in Action", author:"Dierk König et al")
    }.toString()
).book.title == 'Groovy in Action'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another example with @Grab on variable declarations:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Grab('net.sf.json-lib:json-lib:2.3:jdk15')
def builder = new net.sf.json.groovy.JsonGroovyBuilder()

def books = builder.books {
    book(title: "Groovy in Action", author: "Dierk Koenig")
}

assert books.toString() == '''{"books":{"book":{"title":"Groovy in Action","author":"Dierk Koenig"}}}'''
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Remark
****
Please note an improvement in the @Grab annotation: we
provide a shorter version taking just a String as value parameter
representing the dependency, in addition to the more verbose example in
the previous example. You simply append the group, module, version and
classifier together, joined by colons.
****

A Grape *resolver* was added, so you can specify a remote location where
grapes are downloaded from:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------------------
@GrabResolver(name='restlet.org', root='http://maven.restlet.org')
@Grab(group='org.restlet', module='org.restlet', version='1.1.6')
import org.restlet.Restlet
// ...
------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy17releasenotes-PowerAsserts]]
=== Power Asserts

Groovy’s `assert` keyword has sometimes been criticized as it's, in a
way, limited, as it just checks that the expression it’s being passed is
true or false. Unlike with testing frameworks such as JUnit/TestNG and
the various additional assertion utilities, where you get nicer and more
descriptive messages, Groovy’s assert would just tell you the expression
was false, and would give the value of variables used in the expression,
but nothing more. With Power Asserts, initially developed in the
http://spockframework.org/[Spock Framework], the output of the assert is
now much nicer and provides a visual representation of the value of each
sub-expressions of the expression being asserted. For example:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------
assert new File('foo.bar') == new File('example.txt')
-----------------------------------------------------

Will yield:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------
Caught: Assertion failed:

assert new File('foo.bar') == new File('example.txt')
       |                   |  |
       foo.bar             |  example.txt
                           false
-----------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy17releasenotes-AST]]
=== AST

With Groovy 1.6, we introduced AST Transformations, for letting
developers do compile-time metaprogramming, by modifying the Abstract
Syntax Tree before it is transformed into bytecode. In Groovy 1.6,
several such transformations were added, especially ``local''
transformations triggered by annotations (such as @Delegate, @Singleton,
@Bindable and friends). However powerful this feature is, writing AST
transformation has always been a bit tedious. Groovy 1.7 features two
new features which should help simplify the work of AST transformation
writers: an AST viewer and an AST builder.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-ASTViewer]]
==== AST Viewer

The following screenshot shows a new window that can be launched from
the Groovy Swing Console. You can visualize the AST of a script you’re
working on in the console: for instance, writing the code you’d like to
create in your AST transformation. The AST viewer greatly help with
figuring out how Groovy builds its AST when compiling your Groovy
code. +
image:img/AstBrowser.png[image]

[[Groovy17releasenotes-ASTBuilder]]
==== AST Builder

Visualizing the AST is one thing, but we also need a mechanism to create
and modify ASTs more easily. The introduction of the AST builder
simplifies the authoring of AST transformations, by giving you three
different approaches for working on the AST:

* building from string
* building from code
* building from specification

Before the AST builder, one had to create and instantiate manually all
the various AST nodes. Let’s see how those three forms help with this,
for instance for creating a node representing a constant string.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Buildingfromstring]]
===== Building from string

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
List<ASTNode> nodes = new AstBuilder().buildFromString(''' "Hello" ''')
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Buildingfromcode]]
===== Building from code

[source,groovy]
----------------------------------------------------------------
List<ASTNode> nodes = new AstBuilder().buildFromCode { "Hello" }
----------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Buildingfromspecification]]
====== Building from specification

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------
List<ASTNode> nodes = new AstBuilder().buildFromSpec {
    block {
        returnStatement {
            constant "Hello"
        }
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------

.For more information
****
Please have a look at the documentation on the AST
Builder. You’ll discover the advantages and inconveniences of the
various forms, and why all three are needed depending on what you want
to achieve with the AST.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Otherminorenhancements]]
Other minor enhancements
------------------------

[[Groovy17releasenotes-AbilitytocustomizetheGroovyTruth]]
=== Ability to customize the Groovy Truth

In Groovy, booleans aren’t the sole things which can be evaluated to
true or false, but for instance, null, empty strings or collections are
evaluated to false or true if of length > 0 or non-empty. This notion of
'truth' was coined 'Groovy Truth' in the
http://www.manning.com/koenig/[Groovy in Action] book. With Groovy
Truth, instead of doing frequent null checks, you could simply write:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------
def string = "more than one character"
if (string) { println "the String is neither null nor empty" }
--------------------------------------------------------------

Up until Groovy 1.7, only a small set of classes had a certain meaning
with regards to how they were coerced to a boolean value, but now it is
possible to provide a method for coercion to boolean in your own
classes. For example, the following Predicate class offers the ability
to coerce Predicate instances to true or false, thanks to the
implementation of the boolean `asBoolean()` method:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------
class Predicate {
    boolean value
    boolean asBoolean() { value }
}

assert new Predicate(value: true)
assert !new Predicate(value: false)
-----------------------------------

Is is also possible to use categories or ExpandoMetaClass to inject an
`asBoolean()` method, or to override an existing one (even one on the
small set of classes with special Groovy truth behavior).

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Dependencyupgrades]]
=== Dependency upgrades

Some of the dependencies of Groovy have been upgraded to newer versions.

For instance, Groovy now uses the latest ASM version, which is
``invokedynamic''-ready. So as we progress towards the inclusion of
JSR-292 / invokedynamic, we’ll be ready and be using the latest version
of ASM. We also use the latest version of Ivy which is used by the Grape
dependency module.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-RewriteoftheGroovyScriptEngine]]
=== Rewrite of the GroovyScriptEngine

The GroovyScriptEngine (which is also used by Groovlets) has been
rewritten to solve various dependency issues it was suffering from, and
the outcome of this is that it should also now be much faster overall.

The new logic uses additional phase operations to track dependencies. As
a result the error-prone class loader technique to track them is gone
now. These operations ensure that every script file will be tracked, its
dependencies recorded during compilation and all transitive dependencies
will be calculated. And only scripts will be recorded as dependency, no
classes. The new GroovyScriptEngine also uses only one compilation
``process'' for script compilation which solves the problem of circular
or mutual dependencies, that caused stack overflows in the past. As a
result the new engine can reliably handle dependencies and should be
much faster.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Groovyconsolepreferences]]
=== Groovy console preferences

A small annoyance, especially for developers using big LCD screens: the
Groovy Console didn’t remember preferences of position of the separator
between the coding area and output view, or the font size being used.
This is now fixed, as the console remembers such settings. You won’t
need anymore to adjust the console to your liking each time you run it,
it should now have some more brain cells to remember your preferences.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-NewoutputwindowfortheGroovyconsole]]
=== New output window for the Groovy console

There is a new visualization option for the results of the execution of
your scripts in your Groovy Console. Instead of displaying the results
in the bottom output pane, it’s now possible to use an external window
for viewing those results. Run your script with CTRL-R or CMD-R, you
will see something like the following screenshot. You can then dismiss
the window by hitting Escape, CTRL-W (CMD-W on Macs) or Enter.
image:img/newoutputwindow.png[image] +
 You will also notice the addition of line numbers in the gutter of the
editor area.

[[Groovy17releasenotes-SQLbatchupdatesandtransactions]]
=== SQL batch updates and transactions

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Batchupdates]]
==== Batch updates

The Groovy Sql class now features batch updates, thanks to its new
`withBatch()` method, taking a closure and a statement instance:

[source,groovy]
----------------------------------------------------------------
sql.withBatch { stmt ->
    ["Paul", "Jochen", "Guillaume"].each { name ->
        stmt.addBatch "insert into PERSON (name) values ($name)"
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy17releasenotes-Transactions]]
==== Transactions

Similarly, there’s a `withTransaction()` method added to Sql, which works
also with datasets:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------
def persons = sql.dataSet("person")
sql.withTransaction {
    persons.add name: "Paul"
    persons.add name: "Jochen"
    persons.add name: "Guillaume"
}
-----------------------------------
