:description: Groovy 4.0.4, 3.0.12 and 2.5.18 Release Announcement.

It's been a productive time for the Apache Groovy project recently. We recently released versions 4.0.4, 3.0.12 and 2.5.18 with 42, 21 and 15 fixes and improvements respectively. Two quick highlights for the 4.0.4 release before getting into more details about the release.

Eric Milles has been interacting for many months with the team from the https://github.com/hephaestus-compiler-project/hephaestu[hephaestus project] in particular Stefanos Chaliasos and Thodoris Sotiropoulos. You can think of hephaestus as a fuzzying tool for type checkers, and they have been putting Groovy's static compiler through its paces finding plenty of edge cases for us to assess. We still have some work to do, but we have made significant improvements and would welcome any feedback. If you're interested, consider diving further into the https://pldi22.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2022-pldi/2/Finding-Typing-Compiler-Bug[research behind hephaestus].

We've also had some great contributions from Sandip Chitale for Groovy's Object Browser. You can access this from a number of ways including the `:inspect` command in groovysh or in the GroovyConsole via the `Script->Inspect Last` or `Script->Inspect Variables` menu items. It's also hooked into the AST Browser if you're exploring code produced by the Groovy compiler.
