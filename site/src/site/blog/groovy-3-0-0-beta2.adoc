:description: Groovy 3.0.0-beta-2 Windows Installer Release Announcement.

The Windows installer for Groovy 3.0.0-beta-2 is now available from Bintray:
https://bintray.com/groovy/Distributions/download_file?file_path=groovy-3.0.0-beta-2-installer.exe

I've again included a preview of an msi built with WiX, which I'm seeking feedback on:
https://bintray.com/groovy/Distributions/download_file?file_path=groovy-3.0.0-beta-2+%28preview+installer%29.msi

Be aware that you need to fully uninstall the NSIS based Groovy installation before installing with an MSI installer.
