:description: Groovy 3.0.0-alpha-4 Release Announcement.

Dear community,

image:img/groovy_logo.png[Groovy logo,200,float="right"]
The Apache Groovy team is pleased to announce version 3.0.0-alpha-4 of
Apache Groovy. We expect this to be the last "alpha" release of Groovy
3.0.0 as we shift our focus to releasing this next version of Groovy.

2018 was an exciting year for Groovy with download numbers going over
100M in 2018 for the first time. We also had 18 releases and over 30
new contributors. Thanks to you all! We expect 2019 to be even more
exciting as we bring to fruition the hard work (including hundreds of
improvements and fixes) that have already gone into 3.0.0.

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the JVM.
Further details can be found at the http://groovy.apache.org website.

This is a pre-release of a new version of Groovy.
We greatly appreciate any feedback you can give us when using this version.

This release includes 138 bug fixes/improvements as outlined in the changelog:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12318123&version=12343541

Sources, convenience binaries, downloadable documentation and an SDK
bundle can be found at: http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html
We recommend you verify your installation using the information on that page.

Jars are also available within the major binary repositories.

We welcome your help and feedback and in particular want
to thank everyone who contributed to this release.

The Apache Groovy team.
