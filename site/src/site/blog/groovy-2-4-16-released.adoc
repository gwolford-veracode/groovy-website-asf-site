Dear community,

The Apache Groovy team is pleased to announce version 2.4.16 of Apache Groovy.
Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the JVM.
Further details can be found at the http://groovy.apache.org website.

This release is a maintenance release of the GROOVY_2_4_X branch.
While we recommend moving to the current 2.5.x releases (currently 2.5.4),
for any users who can't upgrade to 2.5 and are using 2.4.x versions,
we strongly recommend that you upgrade to this version.

This release includes 18 bug fixes/improvements as outlined in the changelog:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12318123&version=12342996

Sources, convenience binaries, downloadable documentation and an SDK
bundle can be found at: http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html

We recommend you verify your installation using the information on that page.

Jars are also available within the major binary repositories.

We welcome your help and feedback and in particular want
to thank everyone who contributed to this release.
