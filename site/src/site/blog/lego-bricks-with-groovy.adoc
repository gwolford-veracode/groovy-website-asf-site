:description: This post compares Groovy built-in capabilities to Java and Eclipse Collections.

https://twitter.com/TheDonRaab[Donald Raab] has continued has interesting
series on learning https://www.eclipse.org/collections/[Eclipse Collections].
His latest blog post, https://donraab.medium.com/getting-started-with-eclipse-collections-part-4-a72eb23cce0e[part 4], looks at _processing information in collections_.

== Basic Collection Processing

Donald has a useful comparison table of operations for basic
collection processing. We'll add a Groovy column:

|===
|Operation |Eclipse Collections |Java Streams |Groovy

|Do
|`forEach` +
(or `each`)
|`forEach`
|`each`

|Filter
|`select` (include) +
`reject` (exclude) +
`partition` (both)
|`filter` +
`filter` (negated predicate) +
`Collectors.partitioningBy`
|`findAll` +
`findAll` (negated predicate) +
`split`

|Transform
|`collect`
|`map`
|`collect`

|Find
|`detect`
|`filter().findFirst().orElse(null)`
|`find`

|Test
|`anySatisfy` +
`allSatisfy` +
`nonSatisfy`
|`anyMatch` +
`allMatch` +
`noneMatch`
|`any` +
`every` +
`every` (negated predicate)

|Count
|`count`
|`filter().count()`
|`count`
|===

We highly recommend reading Donald's blog post to give more
context for these categories.

Also note that while Groovy has built-in collection processing capabilities
(the third column),
it also _works well with Eclipse Collections and Java Streams_.
So, the first two columns are equally valid when using Groovy too.

== Our example domain

We are going to follow one of the examples, that of Lego bricks, in Donald's post.

We'll simplify the example slightly for our purposes and for this post, ignore the different
block types.

So, we'll start with a color enum. We are just interested in representing simple blocks and
use the colored dots to represent the top view of a block:

[source,groovy]
----
enum Color {
    RED("🔴"),
    YELLOW("🟡"),
    BLUE("🔵"),
    GREEN("🟢"),
    WHITE("⚪️"),
    BLACK("⚫️")

    final String circle

    Color(String circle) {
        this.circle = circle
    }
}
----

We'll have a similar record to Donald's post for dimensions
(but include a `toString()`:

[source,groovy]
----
record Dimensions(int width, int length) {
    String toString() { "$length X $width" }
}
----

Now, our lego brick record just combines the color and dimensions:

[source,groovy]
----
record LegoBrick(Color color, Dimensions dimensions) {
    LegoBrick(Color color, int width, int length) {
        this(color, new Dimensions(width, length))
    }

    static generateMultipleSizedBricks(int count, Set<Color> colors, Set<Dimensions> sizes) {
        [[colors, sizes].combinations() * count]*.collect{
            Color c, Dimensions d -> new LegoBrick(c, d)
        }.sum()
    }

    String toString() {
        ([color.circle * dimensions.length] * dimensions.width).join('\n')
    }

    int length() {
        dimensions.length()
    }

    int width() {
        dimensions.width()
    }
}
----

While we don't use it in this post, we created an additional constructor
for making it easier to create bricks of certain sizes.
There's also a factory method for putting together collections of bricks.

== Some bricks to play with

The first thing we do in our test script is set up some bricks to use
in the remaining examples:

[source,groovy]
----
Set sizes = [[1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4]].collect {
    h, w -> new Dimensions(h, w)
}
Set colors = Color.values()
var bricks = LegoBrick.generateMultipleSizedBricks(5, colors, sizes)
assert bricks.size() == 150
----

The type of brick is determined by its color and size.
There are FIVE different sizes, and SIX colors.
There are FIVE of each type in the collection.
Which makes a total of 150 bricks.

== Using `each` ("Do")

[source,groovy]
----
Set seen = []
bricks.shuffled().each {
    if (seen.add(it.dimensions)) {
        println "$it ($it.dimensions)"
    }
}
----

We shuffle the bricks and them process them one by one.
If we see a brick of a size we haven't seen before we output it, and its size.

The output will be similar to this:

----
🔴🔴 (2 X 1)
🔵🔵🔵 (3 X 1)
⚫️⚫️⚫️
⚫️⚫️⚫️ (3 X 2)
🔴🔴
🔴🔴 (2 X 2)
⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️
⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️ (4 X 2)
----

Due to the shuffling, you might see different colors or a different order for the sizes.

== Using `findAll` ("Filter")

Let's now find the unique sizes for red bricks that are of width two (and we'll sort them by length):

[source,groovy]
----
var redWidthTwo = bricks.findAll(b -> b.width() == 2 && b.color == RED)
        .toSet()
        .sort(LegoBrick::length)
assert redWidthTwo.join(',\n') == '''\
🔴🔴
🔴🔴,
🔴🔴🔴
🔴🔴🔴,
🔴🔴🔴🔴
🔴🔴🔴🔴'''
----

== Using `split` (also "Filter")

Let's find the bricks of length 4 or more (and we'll find just the
unique variations and sort them by color):

[source,groovy]
----
def (selected, rejected) = bricks.findAll(b -> b.length() > 3)
        .toSet()
        .sort(LegoBrick::color)
        .split { b ->
            switch (b.color) {
                case GREEN, WHITE, YELLOW -> true
                case BLUE, RED, BLACK -> false
            }
        }

assert selected.join(',\n') == '''
    🟡🟡🟡🟡
    🟡🟡🟡🟡,
    🟢🟢🟢🟢
    🟢🟢🟢🟢,
    ⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️
    ⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️
'''.stripIndent().trim()
assert rejected.join(',\n') == '''
    🔴🔴🔴🔴
    🔴🔴🔴🔴,
    🔵🔵🔵🔵
    🔵🔵🔵🔵,
    ⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️
    ⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️
'''.stripIndent().trim()
----

== Using `collect` ("Transform")

Let's transform each brick into the toString for its dimensions and then find the unique values:

[source,groovy]
----
Set dims = bricks.collect(b -> b.dimensions.toString()).toUnique()
assert dims == ['2 X 1', '2 X 2', '3 X 1', '3 X 2', '4 X 2'] as Set
----

== Using `find` ("Find")

Let's shuffle the bricks again (no cheating here!) and then find the first
green brick of width and length 2:

[source,groovy]
----
var greenTwoByTwo = bricks.shuffled().find {
    b -> b.width() == b.length() && b.color == GREEN
}
assert greenTwoByTwo.toString() == '🟢🟢\n🟢🟢'
----

== Using `any` and `every` ("Test")

Let's check that there are no 1 x 1 (or some kind of 0 size bricks).
Either the width or length must be strictly greater than 1.
Also, let's check there is some brick where the width is the same as the length
(recall our earlier `greenTwoByTwo` as just one example).

[source,groovy]
----
assert bricks.every { b -> b.width() > 1 || b.length() > 1 }
assert bricks.any { b -> b.width() == b.length() }
----

== Using `count` ("Count")

Let's count how many green bricks there are,
and how many have length of 4:

[source,groovy]
----
assert bricks.count { b -> b.color == GREEN } == 25
assert bricks.count { b -> b.length() == 4 } == 30
----

== A mosaic of bricks

In our final example, we took a mosaic of bricks from (1 x 1)
and larger sizes and put them together. We took the toString
and to save space (and bring a moment of suspense) we compressed it
and encoded it in chunked base64. Your challenge, should you choose
to accept it, is to decode the brick mosaic from its compressed
representation. Here is some code that might help:

[source,groovy]
----
var encodedCompressedLegoMosaic = '''

'''.trim()

var os = new ByteArrayOutputStream()

try (var ios = new InflaterOutputStream(os)) {
    ios.write(encodedCompressedLegoMosaic.decodeBase64())
}
println os
----

The output is left as an exercise for the reader (but
if you try on a terminal, you should have at least a
72 x 36 layout, and use a terminal that supports unicode).

Spoiler alert: if you don't want to run the script yourself, try it

== Conclusion

We have had a quick look at some of Groovy's basic collection processing
functionality. We've really only touched the surface. Take a look at
an earlier blog post giving a Groovy list processing
https://groovy.apache.org/blog/groovy-list-processing-cheat-sheet[cheat sheet]
if you want to see a whole lot more methods.
Also, we highly recommend you try out all of the Eclipse Collections
examples in Donald's original post using Groovy.
